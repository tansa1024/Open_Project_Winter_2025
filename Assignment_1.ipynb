Mathematically, for a state $\\rho$ and a measurement operator $M_k$, the probability of outcome $k$ is $p(k) = Tr(M_k \\rho)$.\n",

They also have **wide toolkit support**, simplifying the coding and analysis aspects of the tomography. While they require multiple measurement bases (X, Y, Z) for informational completeness, this is often a practical trade-off for their ease of use and direct physical interpretation."
