    "Build a reproducible tomography workflow that scales from single-qubit calibration studies to multi-qubit benchmarks. Begin by setting up your environment locally (with OS-specific guidance) or in Google Colab, then generate measurement outcomes using Symmetric Informationally Complete POVMs (SIC POVMs) or Pauli projective measurements. Extend the pipeline with random or AI-assisted circuits and document the trade-offs you observe.\n",
