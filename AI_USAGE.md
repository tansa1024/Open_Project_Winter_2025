# AI Attribution & Usage

## Disclosure
This project was developed with the assistance of an AI coding assistant (Google Gemini family).

## Usage Details

### Code Generation
- **Architecture Design**: The Transformer architecture and Cholesky decomposition constraint layer were designed in collaboration with the AI to ensure physical validity.
- **Boilerplate**: Standard training loops, data loaders, and file I/O were generated by the AI to accelerate development.
- **Verification**: All mathematical implementations (e.g., Fidelity calculation, Cholesky logic) were manually reviewed against quantum information theory textbooks (e.g., Nielsen & Chuang) to ensure correctness.

### Documentation
- The structure and initial drafts of `MODEL_WORKING.md` and `REPLICATION_GUIDE.md` were generated by the AI and refined by the user.

### Specific Prompts Used
- "Implement a Cholesky decomposition layer in PyTorch to enforce density matrix constraints."
- "Create a synthetic data generator for classical shadows protocol."
- "Write a PyTorch training loop for density matrix reconstruction."
